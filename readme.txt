The project is partially complete. SRAM_WR is not working on board.


We included customized directories for each of the components SRAM_RD, SRAM_WR and USER_APP. One for SRAM read and user_app with the provided sram_wr code. COMPLETE_CKT folder consists of all our entities- the sram_rd, sram_wr and user_app. Two folders for software codes – one for testing SRAM and another for testing the whole circuit.
Each folder consists:
1.	VHDL folder – consists of all the vhdl files used for ISE project and dimetalk.
2.	DIMETALK PROJECT folder – consists of the project dt.dt3 file
3.	BITFILE folder – has the generated bit file.
